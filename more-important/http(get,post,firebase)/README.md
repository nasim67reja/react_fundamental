# Fetch data from API

## This tutorial is about how to fetch data from api by the help of async await and fecth api

### Starter

the starter application contains three major file `App.js` ,`MovieList.js` and `Movie.js`. app.js file contains the dummy data

```JavaScript
import MoviesList from './components/MoviesList';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const dummyMovies = [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Some Dummy Movie',
      openingText: 'This is the opening text of the movie',
      releaseDate: '2021-05-18',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Some Dummy Movie 2',
      openingText: 'This is the second opening text of the movie',
      releaseDate: '2021-05-19',
    },
  ];

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <section>
        <button>Fetch Movies</button>
      </section>
      <section>
        <MoviesList movies={dummyMovies} />
      </section>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Then the MovieList file -

```JavaScript

import Movie from './Movie';
import classes from './MoviesList.module.css';

const MovieList = (props) => {
  return (
    <ul className={classes['movies-list']}>
      {props.movies.map((movie) => (
        <Movie
          key={movie.id}
          title={movie.title}
          releaseDate={movie.releaseDate}
          openingText={movie.openingText}
        />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default MovieList;

```

The final Movie File (This is the basic pattern of maxi ðŸ˜Š)

```JavaScript
import classes from './Movie.module.css';

const Movie = (props) => {
  return (
    <li className={classes.movie}>
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      <h3>{props.releaseDate}</h3>
      <p>{props.openingText}</p>
    </li>
  );
};

export default Movie;

```

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Built with

- Reactjs
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow

- The API I used in this project

```JavaScript
const requests = {
  requestPopular: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=${key}&language=en-US&page=1`,
  requestTopRated: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated?api_key=${key}&language=en-US&page=1`,
  requestUpComing: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?api_key=${key}&language=en-US&page=1`,
};
```

### What I learned

- connecting with api by the help of fetch was awesome for me.But i still have some problem with fetch api I mean how to fetch data from server into my react application.I think I need to focus on this topic for my upcoming project.
- This is also my first time with tailwind CSS. Tailwind css is awesome I like their utility class it's save a lot of time for building application.I also need to enhance my skills on Tailwind by building other projects
